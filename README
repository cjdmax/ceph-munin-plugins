needs a few environment vars in munin plugin conf, liek so:
[ceph_osd_*]
user root
env.cephosdasok /var/run/ceph/ceph-osd.

The ceph OSD number and .asok ext is added by the script to make /run/ceph/ceph.osd.0.asok

Only the OSD scripts have been edited to detect OSD number and include the wheelfile. Lazy.
