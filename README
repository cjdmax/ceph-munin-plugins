Please install python-munin (http://samuelks.com/python-munin/) to use
this software. Make your own WHL file for this

Please visit https://bitbucket.org/ebo/ceph-munin-plugins

needs a few environment vars in munin plugin conf, liek so:
[ceph_osd_*]
user root
env.cephosdasok /var/run/ceph/ceph-osd.

You should have symlinks with names like ceph_osd_12_bytes linked to the ceph_osd_bytes scripts. The OSD ID is extracted from the script name not unlike other munin plugins like if_err_ etcetera

The ceph OSD number and .asok ext is added by the script to make /run/ceph/ceph.osd.0.asok

Only the OSD scripts have been edited to detect OSD number and include the wheelfile. Lazy.
